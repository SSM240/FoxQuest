# Fox Quest
Just a small [PICO-8](https://lexaloffle.itch.io/pico-8) platformer game featuring a fox.

Very WIP currently - as of 2021-08-09, the only thing currently functional is very basic movement and some player sprites. The plan is to eventually have two main areas, each with three "levels" and a boss, but that's subject to change depending on how things go. (and assumes I'll even finish the dang thing, which isn't a guarantee ;-;)
